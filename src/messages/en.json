    "questions": [
      {"category": "general", "q": "How is Campana different from Google Smart Bidding or Meta Advantage+?", "a": "Campana is a complete marketing command center, not just a bidding tool. You get: (1) a unified dashboard showing all campaigns across Google + Meta, (2) AI optimization for bids and budgets with full transparency, (3) AI copywriting assistance for ad headlines and descriptions, and (4) strategic insights like cross-platform budget allocation. Platform tools optimize for platform revenue (more spend = more profit) and trap you in separate dashboards. Campana is independent — we optimize for your CPA and ROAS targets across both platforms."},
      {"category": "general", "q": "Will this conflict with Smart Bidding if I'm already using it?", "a": "Yes. You should turn off Smart Bidding on campaigns managed by Campana — running both will cause them to fight each other. Campana replaces Smart Bidding with a more transparent approach that works better for lower-volume accounts."},
      {"category": "general", "q": "What ad platforms do you support?", "a": "Currently Google Ads and Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads. LinkedIn Ads, TikTok, and Amazon Sponsored Ads are on our roadmap."},
      {"category": "general", "q": "Does Campana show all my campaigns in one place?", "a": "Yes. The unified dashboard displays all your Google Ads and Meta campaigns side by side with normalized metrics (spend, conversions, CPA, ROAS, CTR). No more switching tabs or copying data into spreadsheets to compare cross-platform performance."},
      {"category": "howItWorks", "q": "How much time could this save?", "a": "Our goal is to reduce the time spent reviewing campaigns from 2-3 hours of manual dashboard checking and spreadsheet analysis down to a 10-15 minute review of AI-proposed optimizations. We're still measuring real-world time savings with early users."},
      {"category": "howItWorks", "q": "What if I don't like a recommendation?", "a": "Reject it with one click. Campana learns from your rejections and adjusts future recommendations."},
      {"category": "howItWorks", "q": "Can Campana write ad copy for me?", "a": "Yes. The AI copywriting engine generates 3-5 headline and description variants optimized for CTR based on your existing top performers and platform best practices. You review and approve the ones you like."},
      {"category": "howItWorks", "q": "How does the AI make decisions? Is it just ChatGPT?", "a": "No. Campana uses Thompson Sampling (a Bayesian statistical method) for bid and budget optimization — not a generic language model. For copywriting, we use a language model fine-tuned specifically on ad copy, not generic ChatGPT. The optimization math is a purpose-built statistical engine."},
      {"category": "howItWorks", "q": "How does cross-client learning work without sharing data?", "a": "We pool anonymized statistical priors (performance distributions) across your agency's accounts. The raw data from each client stays strictly isolated — only aggregate patterns are shared to improve cold-start performance for new campaigns."},
      {"category": "pricing", "q": "What happens during the free trial?", "a": "Full access to the Starter tier for 14 days, no credit card required. The agent analyzes and proposes optimizations but won't execute them until you subscribe. This lets you judge recommendation quality risk-free."},
      {"category": "pricing", "q": "Do you charge based on ad spend?", "a": "No. Flat monthly fee based on number of accounts. This aligns our incentives — we succeed when your ROI improves, not when you spend more."},
      {"category": "pricing", "q": "Can I cancel anytime?", "a": "Yes. No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime. Data retained for 30 days in case you want to reactivate."},
      {"category": "safety", "q": "What if the AI makes a mistake?", "a": "Every action stores rollback data (the previous value). One-click revert. Guardrails prevent extreme changes (e.g., max 20% bid increase). Circuit breakers auto-pause if performance degrades."},
      {"category": "safety", "q": "Is my data secure?", "a": "OAuth 2.0, Fernet encryption (AES-128-CBC) for all tokens, tenant isolation at the database level, GDPR compliant."},
      {"category": "safety", "q": "Do you access my billing data?", "a": "No. We only access campaign performance data, keyword data, and ad metadata. Never billing, payment methods, or personal data from your ads."},
      {"category": "technical", "q": "How much ad spend do I need?", "a": "Minimum 5 000 PLN/month per account. Below that, there isn't enough conversion volume for data-driven optimization to outperform manual management."},
      {"category": "technical", "q": "How does Campana handle seasonal changes like Black Friday?", "a": "The Thompson Sampling model automatically adapts to recent trends. You can also manually adjust CPA/ROAS targets before high-traffic periods."},
      {"category": "technical", "q": "What technology stack does Campana use?", "a": "FastAPI (Python) backend, PostgreSQL database, Redis for caching, Clerk for authentication."}
